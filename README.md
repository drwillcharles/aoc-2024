# Advent of Code 2024 - Using Rust!

I find it hard to pick up new coding languages without an end goal, so I challenged myself to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) as a goal.

### Create a new package

I decided to create a package for each day. May need to change this to each part of each day:
`cargo new day1`

### Run the code

To compile and run the code:
```bash
cd day1
cargo run --bin part2
```
